Project Proposal:

Reading the data:

website: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

For each file run wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv, changing the 2009-01 part to the year/month you are interested in

Variables of Interest: Latitude/Longitude of pickup, Latitude/Longitude of dropoff, cab fare, tip amount, number of passengers

Statistical Methods: Unsure

Computational Steps: Gather data and run each file in parallel using the CHTC. Each file is ~2 GB, so it makes sense to run each in parallel.
